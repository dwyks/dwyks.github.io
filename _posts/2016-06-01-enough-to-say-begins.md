This is the beginning of _Enough to Say_, my personal blog about things that matter to me ... _enough to say._ This includes personal stuff, professional stuff, and other stuff.

Who am I?

My name is Dan Wyks. I live and work near Denver, CO. I am a father and husband. I am a Rush fanatic. I am a novice adventure motorcyclist. I am an IT professional. More specifically I am a software development manager with a background in system development. I am a devoted agilist and Kanban enthusiast. And as of this post I am the President of Agile Denver.

_Enough to Say_ comes from the lyrics of the first verse of _Headlong Flight_ by Rush.

> All the journeys  
Of this great adventure  
It didn’t always feel that way  
I wouldn’t trade them  
Because I made them  
The best I could  
And that’s enough to say

So that's all well and good, but what **really** matters to me ... _enough to say?_ I don't plan to write to hear myself speak. On the personal side I want to share events and subjects that really matter to me. It's a safe bet that will include writing about motorcycling and music. On the professional side I want to share my experiences, knowledge, and thoughts; and occasionally I will challenge the thoughts of others. Professionally I plan to write about Agile, leadership, and software development. Beyond that there will be ... other stuff. And you can be sure Rush references will show up in some unlikely places.

I hope you enjoy.

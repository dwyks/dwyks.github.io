# About _Enough to Say_  

_Enough to Say_ is my personal blog where I write about things that matter to me ... _enough to say._ This includes personal stuff like hobbies and music, professional stuff like Agile and software development, and other stuff.

_Enough to Say_ comes from the lyrics of the first verse of _Headlong Flight_ by Rush.

> All the journeys
Of this great adventure
It didn’t always feel that way
I wouldn’t trade them
Because I made them
The best I could
And that’s enough to say
